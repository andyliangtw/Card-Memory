# Card-Memory
Final Project of "Programming Design" in 106-1, taught by Professor Ling-Chieh Kung.  

## Description & Rules
This is a classic game.  
There is a 4x4 table with 16 covered cards on it, and you have to choose two cards to open.  
If two cards are the same, keep the cards been opened.  
It not, cover them.  
Repeat this procedure until all the cards are opened.  
Challenge your ability of memory.  

## How-to build the game
This game is developed by **cocos2d**, and here are source codes instead of released executive files.
So, if you want to play this game, you have to download [Cocos2d-x](https://cocos2d-x.org/download) and settle the developing environment.  
Here I won't teach you how to set the environment, sorry for the inconvenience. Please Google it by yourself.  

## Special Thanks
This is not a game developed only by myself. (My part is UI & Game Logic)  
Thanks to my team members. Without your efforts, I can't have such a good game.  
Thanks to my teachers, Professor Ling-Chieh Kung, too.  

## Appendix
If you have any questions, please comment or contact me without hesitation. I'm glad to have your advices :)
